Function pointers and folding?
Inner product?
Long integers?
Something like mod-avgs.tex in the exam problems -- need a situation where they
can use the vector as a lookup table for a function.  Any of these would work:

	* histogram
	* frequency table
	* checking for presence of all characters in a string
	* checking for all remainders after division by some value m
	* sums or averages by category
	* perhaps you could count the number of base 10 digits and then get an
	 average for each one?
